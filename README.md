The only non vanilla thing I used was `sass`. To ensure the project diplays correctly, the styles must be first compiled using the following command (after ensuring, that `sass` is installed). Afterwards, everything should work straight out of the box.

```bash
sass styles.scss styles.css
```

I also used the `:has` property in my styles, which is not yet supported by all browsers. There are workarounds which could be implemented if necessary, but i decided against such a practise in the interest of time and brevity.
